Background
--------------
Every year we poll the [Sakai community](http://www.sakaiproject.org "Sakai Project")  which is a project overseen by the [Apereo Foundation](http://apereo.org "Apereo Foundation"), to learn which Sakai tools are most commonly used. As part of this effort we deploy a manual survey, and we provide SQL scripts that institutions may run locally and send us back the results. The scripts in this repository aggregate the results. The results are first shared with the Sakai governance body, the PMC (Project Management Committee, modelled on the Apache PMC) and then shared publicly.

For more information contact the Sakai Community Coordinator, <sakaicoordinator@apereo.org> .
